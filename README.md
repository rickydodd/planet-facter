# Planet Facter

Planet Facter is a planet facts web app. It provides interesting information on Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, including overview information, internal structure, and surface geology, as well as rotation time, revolution time, radius, and average temperature.

## The Challenge

### About Frontend Mentor

The [Planet fact site](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f) is a challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). They provide a Figma file, some design sketches, and assets (images, fonts). Implementing the wesbite or web app is my challenge.

### Selected Technologies

I want to build a stronger familiarity with React. As such, I will use React to accomplish this challenge. I could go framework-less, but I also want to build up a familiarity with the directory structure and code structure provided by a framework, so I have trivially selected [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the framework. I am also looking to express my understanding of HTML, including accessibility; CSS, including the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework; and TypeScript.

### Other Considerations

While Frontend Mentor provides me with "starter code," I have pre-emptively decided to discard the starter code in favour of the JSON data they provided, so that I can build the website programmatically from this data.

## Run Planet Facter Server

### Development Mode

You can run the Planet Facter server in development mode by navigating to the directory and executing one of the following commands, where relevant to your installed toolchain:
